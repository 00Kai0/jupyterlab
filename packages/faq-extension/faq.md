### How stable is JupyterLab?

This beta version of JupyterLab is ready for you to use! The JupyterLab beta
series of releases are characterized by:

* Stable and featureful enough for daily usage.
* Most of the commonly used features in the classic Notebook are
  implemented.
* Developer APIs that are approaching stability, but still undergoing
  significant changes.

In 2018, we will release the 1.0 version of JupyterLab that will
provide additional UI/UX improvements, features, and API stability. At
that point, JupyterLab should be a full featured replacement for the
classic Notebook and go far beyond its capabilities. Between now and then,
we will release a series of beta releases, all of which should be stable
for daily usage.

### What will happen to the classic Jupyter Notebook?

JupyterLab is intended to be a full replacement for the classic Jupyter
Notebook. Because of this, our plan is to gradually retire the classic Jupyter
Notebook after JupyterLab 1.0 is released. However, we will support the classic
notebook for a significant period of time to help users and extension authors
through this transition. It is important to note that the notebook server and
the notebook document format is unchanged during this transition.
