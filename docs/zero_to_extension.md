# Zero to Extension

Goal: Document in a single page how to go from absolutely no JupyterLab, conda, Node, TypeScript, etc. materials on your machine to having a local instance of JupyterLab running with a basic extension installed for dev iteration. Be opinionated and doc *one* path to setup with conda.

## Prerequisites




## Questions / Thoughts

* Don't want to maintain the dev setup steps here if they're also in the contributing doc and extesnion pages and ... but it's also hard as a newbie to trace through all of them. Solve this later I guess.
* Knowing how to package an extension for release is another useful tidbit this tutorial might cover, but perhaps that should be separate.
